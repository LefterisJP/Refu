/**
 ** @memberof RF_TextFile
 ** @brief Initializes a new text file
 **
 ** This function initializes a new textfile object. You have the option to
 ** either open an already existing TextFile by using
 ** either @c RF_FILE_READ , @c RF_FILE_WRITE or @c RF_FILE_READWRITE for the
 ** @c mode argument. In that case the file shall also
 ** be tested for the existence of a Byte Order Mark.
 **
 ** To create a new file use either @c RF_FILE_NEW or @c RF_FILE_READWRITE_NEW.
 ** A Byte Order Mark will be appened to the file
 ** depending on the given @c encoding argument unless the library has been
 ** compiled with the @c RF_OPTION_TEXTFILE_ADDBOM off.
 ** Note that if a specific endianess for UTF-16 or UTF-32 is not given then
 ** the file will be created in the system's endianess.
 ** @lmsFunction
 ** @param t                      The textfile to initialize
 ** @param name                   The name of the file.
 **                               @inhtype{String,StringX} @tmpSTR
 ** @param mode                   The mode with which to access the file.
 **                               Should be one of the following values:
 **                                   + @c RF_FILE_READ: Opens an already
 **                                     existing file for writting.
 **                                   + @c RF_FILE_WRITE: Opens an already
 **                                     existing file for writting. If the
 **                                     file does not exist it is created. If
 **                                     it exists its contents <b>are not</b>
 **                                     erased.
 **                                   + @c RF_FILE_NEW: Opens a file for writing.
 **                                     If the file already exists its contents
 **                                     are erased.
 **                                   + @c RF_FILE_READWRITE: Opens a file for
 **                                        both reading and writting. The file
 **                                        must exist.
 **                                   + @c RF_FILE_READWRITE_NEW: Opens a new file
 **                                        both both reading and writting. If the
 **                                        file already exists its contents are
 **                                        erased.
 **
 **                               This parameter serves as but a hint of what
 **                               operation should follow the initialization. 
 **                               The reason is that each of the functions that
 **                               operate on an @ref RF_TextFile check the 
 **                               current mode and if it is not the legal mode
 **                               for that operation the file is reopened with
 **                               the proper mode, or has its file pointer
 **                               rewinded and then put back if it is in
 **                               read/write mode.
 ** @param endianess              The endianess of the file. Is useful only if
 **                               the encoding of the file is in UTF-32 or UTF-16.
 **                               The legal values for this field are 
 **                               @c RF_LITTLE_ENDIAN or @c RF_BIG_ENDIAN or
 **                               @c RF_ENDIANESS_UNKNOWN. In the latter case
 **                               the file is scanned in an attempt to determine
 **                               its endianess
 ** @param encoding               The encoding of the file. Can be one of:
 **                                   + @c RF_UTF8: For Unicode UTF-8 encoding
 **                                   + @c RF_UTF16: For Unicode UTF-16 encoding
 **                                   + @c RF_UTF32: For Unicode UTF-32 encoding
 **
 ** @param eol                    The End Of Line type that this textfile uses.
 **                               The value of @c RF_EOL_AUTO should not be given
 **                               if this is a newly created file. If that is done
 **                               an invalid argument error is logged and the file
 **                               is initialized with @c RF_EOL_LF. In addition
 **                               if the auto-detection fails for some reason
 **                               the default @c RF_EOL_LF will be used and
 **                               appropriate error logging will be performed.
 **                               The default value is @c RF_EOL_LF.
 **                               Possible values are:
 **                                   + @c RF_EOL_AUTO: For the function to
 **                                     attempt and auto detect the line
 **                                     endings used by the file
 **                                   + @c RF_EOL_LF: For Unix-style line endings,
 **                                     taking @c '\n' as the end of line signal
 **                                   + @c RE_EOL_CR: For Macintosh-style line
 **                                     endings, taking @c '\r' as the end of
 **                                     line signal
 **                                   + @c RF_EOL_CRLF: For Windows-style line
 **                                        endings, taking @c "\r\n"
 **                                        as the end of line signal
 **
 ** @return                       Returns @c true in success

 **
 ** Searches the text file for line @c lineN with the first line being @c 1.
 ** When found it returns the line by assigning @c line's contents to the
 ** given string. The user is responsible of freeing that string later himself.
 **
 ** The function starts a search for the appropriate line from the beginning
 ** of the file retrieving the lines one by one until it reaches the required
 ** line at @c lineN. For a function that deduces how to search for the line
 ** by comparing the current line with the requested one take a look
 ** at @ref rfTextFile_GetLine()
 **
 ** If no line @c lineN exists and the file ends before that line is found then
 ** the function returns @c RE_FILE_EOF and nothing happens to the passed
 ** string at @c line.
 **
 ** An important thing to note about the usage of this function is that when a
 ** line is found the internal file pointer and the current line are not
 ** changed. This just retrieves the lines without moving the file pointer or
 ** changing the line.
 ** @param[in] t The textfile to get the line from
 ** @param[in] lineN The number of line to retrieve. Indexing starts from @c 1
 ** for the first line. Do not give 0 here. If 0 is given then error is returned
 ** @param[out] line Here give an @ref RF_StringX that will receive the read
 ** line. The string must <b>already be initialized</b> before being passed to
 ** the function. It is recommended to initialize a string with the
 ** @ref rfStringX_Init_txtbuff() macro
 ** @return Returns @c RF_SUCCESS if everything went all right. If there was a
