 ** @brief Gets a number of bytes from a UTF8 file descriptor
 **
 ** This is a function that's similar to c library fgets but it also returns 
 ** the number of bytes read. Reads in from the file until @c num bytes
 ** have been read or new line or EOF character has been encountered.
 **
 ** The character pattern that shall be considered as newline signal depends
 **  on the value the user passes to the @c eol argument.
 **
 ** The function will read until @c num characters are read and if @c num
 ** would take us to the middle of a UTF16 character then the next character
 **  shall also be read
 ** and the function will return the number of bytes read.
 ** Since the function null terminates the buffer the given @c buff needs to be
 ** of at least @c num+5 size to cater for the worst case.
 **
 ** The final bytestream stored inside @c buff is in the endianess of the system.
 **
 ** If right after the last character read comes the EOF, the function
 ** shall detect so and assign @c true to @c eof.
 **
 ** The file descriptor at @c f must have been opened in <b>binary</b> and 
 ** not text mode. That means that if under
 ** Windows make sure to call fopen with "wb", "rb" e.t.c. instead of the
 ** simple "w", "r" e.t.c. since the initial

 ** http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ktss1a9b.aspx
 **
 ** @param[in] buff A buffer to be filled with the contents of the file.
 **  Should be of size at least @c num+5
 ** @param[in] num The maximum number of bytes to read from within the file
 **  NOT including the null terminating character(which in itelf is 2 bytes).
 **  Should be a multiple of 2
 ** @param[in] f A valid FILE descriptor from which to read the bytes
 ** @param[out] eof Pass a reference to a char to receive a true/false value
 **  for whether EOF has been reached.
 ** @param[in] eol The End Of Line type that this file uses. Legal values are:
 ** + @c RF_EOL_LF: For Unix-style line endings, taking @c '\n' as

 **  You can see how much by checking the return value.
 **
 ** You shall need to provide an integer at @c c to contain either the decoded 
 ** unicode codepoint or the UTF-8 endoced byte depending on the value
 **  of the @c cp argument.
 **
 ** @param[in] f A valid FILE descriptor from which to read the bytes
 ** @param[in] c Pass an int that will receive either the unicode code point
 ** value or the UTF8 bytes depending on the value of the @c cp flag
 ** @param[in] cp A boolean flag. If @c true then the int passed at @c c will
 ** contain the unicode code point of the read character, so the UTF-8 
 ** will be decoded.
 ** If @c false the int passed at @c c will contain the value of the read 
 ** bytes in UTF-8 without any decoding
 ** @param[out] eof The function will use this as a flag to denote if EOF
 **  is reached.
 ** @return Returns the number of bytes read (either @c 1, @c 2, @c 3 or @c 4) 
 ** or a negative number if the function fails. If the EOF is reached then
