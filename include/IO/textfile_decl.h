** @brief TextFile handler
**
** This is a TextFile handler that allows for the manipulation of files that contain
** text in any of the UTF encodings.
**
** It allows for manipulation of a text file without placing the whole file in memory
** and contains many different functions for moving inside the file in regards to specific line positions
** or even retrieving said lines themselves inside an @ref RF_String.
** For individual line parsing it is recommended to use the @ref RF_String and @ref RF_StringX functions.
