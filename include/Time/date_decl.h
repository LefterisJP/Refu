** @brief A cross-platform Date structure
**
** This structure provides a cross-platform way to measure Date and time and its intervals. Its highest resolution is in seconds. It should not be used as a
** timer structure but as a way to retrieve, set or manipulate dates and to measure their intervals. Contains functions that can retrieve the date from the system or set it.
** Also contains functions that can manipulate a date such as @ref rf_date_add_days or @ref rf_date_sub_months which can add days or subtract months from a date
** In some cases the structure can also be interpreted as a time interval. Examples of such usage are in the function that returns the difference between two dates @ref rfDate_Diff.
** In there the third parameter is not interpreted as a Date but as a time interval. For more information look at the individual funtions documentation.
