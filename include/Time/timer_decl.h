** @brief A cross-platform high resolution Timer structure
**
** This is a cross-platform Timer structure that allows the user to implement a timer with different resolutions
** on any system that he might need to. This timer is supposed to be used for high resolution counting such as milliseconds
** microseconds, or nanoseconds.
