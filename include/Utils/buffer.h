 * RFbuffer is a simple buffer with a given size and an index. Functions that
 * use it should remember how many elements they have written in the buffer.
 * The index points to the position in the buffer the last function
 * started using.
 *
 * When a function is done with the buffer it returns the index to where it
 * was before so that all functions withing a single thread can use the same
 * buffer.
 *
 * Functions can interpret the contents of the buffer as any type they need
 * via the use of the provided macros
