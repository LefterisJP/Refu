 ** be used by the user directly. It is used in 2 occasions inside the
 ** library. Once inside the library's
 ** initialization function @ref rfInit() and at every new @ref RF_Thread
 **  initialization since this stack is thread specific.
 ** @param lms The Local Memory stack to initialize
 ** @param size The size that the local memory stack will have
 ** @return Returns @c true if initialized correctly and @c false otherwise

 ** This function simply pushes the local memory stack for @c size bytes so
 ** that the stack pointer gets moved up by that amount of bytes. It also
 ** returns a pointer to the position of the stack pointer before the push
 ** which will be the allocated pointer memory position. In that respect
 ** the function works similarly to malloc()
 ** @param size The size of the block to allocate
 ** @return Returns a pointer to the allocated block or NULL
 **  for no more local memory available

 ** and in doing so essentially frees all the objects that were allocated
 ** to parts of the stack before that movement.
 ** @param t The stack value to which to pop the stack back to
 ** @return Returns @c true for success and @c false if popping was 
 ** attemped up to a point that has not yet been allocated

 ** beginning of the function wrapper we will use all the saved pointer
 ** positions to find the one that is closer at the beginning and this 
 ** will be determined as the local memory stack pointer before the 
 ** function call

 ** specified number of function arguments has been used
