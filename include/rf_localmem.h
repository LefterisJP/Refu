/** @brief The Local Memory stack
**
** This structure represents the local memory stack of a thread
** It contains a stack array along with its pointer that are initialized
** by the compile time option @c RF_OPTION_LOCALSTACKMEMORY_SIZE.
**
** Also contains some additional data for macro evaluations so that the functions
** can determine where the stack pointer was before each function call. They are
** necessary since at function call there is no guarantee which macro will be executed first
** and so in the case of having two macros that create a temporary object a way was needed to determine
** which came first and hence determine where the stack pointer was before a function call.

//! @brief Initializes the local memory stack
//!
//! This function simply initializes a local memory stack and should not be used by
//! ther user directly. It is used in 2 occasions inside the library. Once inside the library's
//! initialization function @ref rfInit() and at every new @ref RF_Thread initialization since
//! this stack is thread specific.
//! @param lms The Local Memory stack to initialize
//! @param size The size that the local memory stack will have

//! @memberof RF_LocalMemoryStack
//! @brief Pushes the local memory stack
//!
//! This function simply pushes the local memory stack for @c size bytes so that the stack pointer
//! gets moved up by that amount of bytes. It also returns a pointer to the position of the stack
//! pointer before the push which will be the allocated pointer memory position. In that respect
//! the function works similarly to malloc()
//! @param lms The local memory stack to push
//! @param size The size of the block to allocate
//! @return Returns a pointer to the allocated block or 0 for no more local memory available
i_DECLIMEX_ void* rfLMS_Push(RF_LocalMemoryStack* lms,size_t size);


//! @brief Pops the local stack memory back to a certain value
//!
//! This function puts the local stack pointer back to a specific value
//! and in doing so essentially frees all the objects that were allocated to
//! parts of the stack before that movement.
//! @param lms The local memory stack to pop from
//! @param t The stack value to which to pop the stack back to
i_DECLIMEX_ void rfLMS_Pop(RF_LocalMemoryStack* lms,size_t t);

//! @brief Keeps the stack pointer before the specific macro evaluation
//!
//! This function remembers the stack pointer right before a given
//! local macro evaluation. Because of the sequence points there is not a given
//! method to see which macro gets evaluated first so at the beginning of the function
//! wrapper we will use all the saved pointer positions to find the one that is
//! closer at the beginning and this will be determined as the local memory stack
//! pointer before the function call
//!
//! @param lms The local memory stack with which the macro gets evaluated
