** Functions to set, remove and retrieve
** objects from the array exist.
**
** Normal usage is to set an initial size of the array and then set which objects you want.
** If there is a need to increase/decrease the size of the array there is a reallocation method but
** has to be called explicitly. For a data structure that does all these dynamically look
** at RF_ListP and RF_ListV
