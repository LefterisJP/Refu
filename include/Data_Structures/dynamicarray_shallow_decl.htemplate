 ** @brief An array of objects that can grow on demand
 **
 ** Functions to add, remove and retrieve
 ** object from the list exist.
 **
 ** Normal usage is to set an initial capacity of the list and then whenever
 ** more objects are added the capacity gets increased if it goes over the
 ** buffer and it also gets decreased if many objects are removed.
 ** So this is a datastructure to use if you need something that adjusts its
 ** size when needed.
