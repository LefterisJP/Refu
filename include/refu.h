/**
 ** @brief Initializes the ReFu library
 **
 ** This function needs to be called in the very beginning of any program
 ** using the library.
 **
 ** @param errstr           A c string literal with the filename of the log
 **                         to create. If NULL then the value is "refuclib.log"
 ** @param lmsSize          The size of the main thread's local memory stack.
 **                         This will be the size by which the main thread's
 **                         local memory stack will be initialized. It allows
 **                         the usage of macros for temporary object creation.
 **                         If 0 then the compile time constant
 **                         RF_OPTION_LOCALSTACK_MEMORY_SIZE is used.
 ** @param level            The level of the logging system. Possible values
 **                         are enumerated by @ref RFlog_level
 ** @return                 Returns @c true in success
