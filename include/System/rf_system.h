//! @brief Creates a directory
//!
//! This is a wrapper of the mkdir and _mkdir functions. Creates a new directory with the given name.
//! @lmsFunction
//! @param dirname A string with the name of the directory to create. @inhtype{String,StringX} @tmpSTR
//! @param mode This is an optional parameter that only makes sense in Linux. In Windows this does nothing.
//! In Linux pass here the permission bits for the newly created directory. The legal values comes from here
//! and are just wrappers of these values so that they can be visible also in Windows.
//! http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Creating-Directories.html
//! Legal values can be a combination of:
//! + @c RFP_IRUSR or @c RFP_IREAD: Read permission bit for the owner of the file
//! + @c RFP_IWRITE or @c RFP_IWUSR: Write permission bit for the owner of the file
//! + @c RFP_IXUSR or @c RFP_IEXEC: Execute (for ordinary files) or search (for directories) permission bit for the owner of the file
//! + @c RFP_IRWXU: This is equivalent to ‘(@c RFP_IRUSR | @c RFP_IWUSR | @c RFP_IXUSR)’
//! + @c RFP_IRGRP: Reading Permission bit for the group owner of the file
//! + @c RFP_IWGRP: Write permission bit for the group owner of the file
//! + @c RFP_IXGRP: Execute or search permission bit for the group owner of the file
//! + @c RFP_IRWXG: This is equivalent to ‘(@c RFP_IRGRP | @c RFP_IWGRP | @c RFP_IXGRP)’.
//! + @c RFP_IROTH: Read permission bit for other users
//! + @c RFP_IWOTH: Write permission bit for other users
//! + @c RFP_IXOTH: Execute/search permission bit for other users
//! + @c RFP_IRWXO: This is equivalent to ‘(@c RFP_IROTH | @c RFP_IWOTH | @c RFP_IXOTH)’.
//! + @c RFP_ISUID: This is the set-user-ID on execute bit
//! + @c RFP_ISGID: This is the set-group-ID on execute bit
//! + @c RFP_ISVTX: This is the sticky bit
//!
//! @return Returns RF_SUCCESS for success and an error otherwise. Possible errors are:
//! + @c RE_DIRECTORY_CREATE: Generic directory creation error
//! + @c RE_DIRECTORY_EXISTS: The directory already exists
//! + @c RE_DIECTORY_INVALID: The given directory path was invalid
//! + @c RE_PERMISSION: There is insufficient permission to create this directory (POSIX only)
//! + @c RE_DIRECTORY_PARENT_LINKS: The parent has too many entries for the new directory to be created.  (POSIX only)
//! + @c RE_DIRECTORY_SPACE: There is not enough space in the parent  (POSIX only)
//! + @c RE_DIRECTORY_ROPARENT: The parent directory of the directory is read only and can't be modified  (POSIX only)

//! @brief Removes a directory and all its files recursively
//!
//! This functions deletes all the files and chil directories under the given directory and the directory itself.
//! The calling proccess needs to have sufficient permissions.It is quite a dangerous
//! function so be careful when using it since it can recursively delete everything.
//! @lmsFunction
//! @warning This function will permanently delete all the files and children directories of the parameter directory
//! recursively. Do not use it if you are not sure of what you are doing.

//! + @c RE_DIRECTORY_PARENT_LINKS: The parent has too many entries for the new directory to be created.
//! + @c RE_DIRECTORY_NAMELENGTH: The directory can't be accessed because its name is too long for the filesystem
//! + @c RE_DIRECTORY_TOOMANY_FILES: The directory can't be accessed because too many files are currently open in the system
//! + @c RE_DIRECTORY_FILES Directory iteration failed because one of the values of the directory's file structure could not be represented correctly
//! + @c RE_DIRECTORY_STREAMPOS Current position of directory stream is invalid
//! + @c RE_FILE_DELETE A file inside the directory could not be deleted
//! + @c RE_DIRECTORY_DELETE The directory itself could not be deleted
