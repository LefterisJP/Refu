** @brief A cross-platform Semaphore Handle
**
** The Semaphore struct is an object that can provide a count of
** how many units of a particular resource are available and provides
** operations to safely adjust the number of units as they become free
** or are required.
**
** A semaphore's state is signaled when its count is greater than or equal
** to zero and non signaled when it's zero. The count is decreased by 1 whenever
** a thread releases the object by waiting
**
** For an example of Semaphore usage visit the @ref RF_ThreadingPGE_Sec3 "Refu Threading Documentation"
