**
** @brief An extended version of the normal String which offers a movable index and dynamic buffer allocation
**
** The Extended String is an extension over the simple @ref RF_String that adds functionalities that enable moving
** inside the String itself and allocating its size dynamically. This is accomplished by adding two more members to
** the structure:
**
**  <ul><li>A buffer index allowing operations of moving inside the String to happen</li>
**  <li>A buffer size which keeps the size of the buffer allocated for the string</li></ul>
**
** Whenever the size of this String gets over the buffer size, it gets increased. Some functions even decrease the size
** allocated for the String buffer.
**
** This String version has functions that extend it greatly especially for the purposes
** of parsing files/streams and editable text. This String is not intended for being
** used en mass, saved in arrays/vectors e.t.c. For that use the original @ref RF_String
**
** As far as function calling is concerned if an extended version of the function exists (starting with rfStringX)
** then you should use that so that the string's members get updated correctly. If not then just using the normal
** function with an extended string as a parameter will suffice.
** All the normal String functions which have <em class="rf_ability1">Can be used with StringX</em> on their description can be used with extended strings safely, since no specific
** version of the function exists, or needs to exist to manipulate Extended Strings.
**

** @todo Generalize most of the constructors below and let the wrapper generate them
