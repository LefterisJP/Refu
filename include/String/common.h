/**
 ** @memberof RF_String
 ** @brief Create a termporary String from a String literal
 **
 ** A macro to be used only inside a function call that accepts an @ref RF_String or any
 ** inherited data type such as @ref RF_StringX. It creates a Temporary RF_String*
 ** that will be used by the function. This macro accepts from 1 to N arguments.
 **
 ** The first argument shall either be a String literal or a printf styled string literal
 ** given in UTF-8 encoding. Other encodings are easy to support but are not currently
 ** supported since the current limitation is for UTF-8 encoded source code.
 **
 ** Optionally the first argument can be followed by a sequence of additional arguments that would
 ** specify how to format the string @c s. If additional arguments follow then the @c s shall be
 ** formatted using the Refu String formatting rules, more details about which can be found at
 ** @ref rfStringX_Formatv()
 ** @warning
 ** + If no extra arguments are given then the given string @c s is not interpreted as a formatted
 ** string and is instead printed as is.
 ** @warning
 ** + This macro can not be called recursively with extra arguments and doing so is undefined behaviour.
 ** Moreover there is no reason to do so as the example below tries to so.
 ** <br /><b>Illegal and undefined behaviour</b>
 ** @code rfString_Append(&s,RFS_("Never call the %S",RFS_("%s macro recursively with extra arguments such as this %d","RFS macro",1024))); @endcode
 ** The equivalent legal (and more simple way to do the above is:
 ** @code rfString_Append(&s,RFS_("Never call the %s macro recursively with extra arguments such as this %d","RFS macro",1024)); @endcode
 **
 ** @param s The formatted string that will constitute the RF_String. Must be in the same encoding as that of the source file.
 ** Default is UTF-8.
 ** @param ... \rfoptional{nothing}  Depending on the string literal, the function may expect a sequence of additional arguments,
 ** each containing one value to be inserted instead of each %-tag specified in the @c slit parameter, if any. There should be
 ** the same number of these arguments as the number of %-tags that expect a value.
 ** @return Returns true in case of correct initialization and false , due to invalid byte sequence for the given encoding
 ** @isinherited{StringX}
