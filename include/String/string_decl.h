** @brief A unicode String with UTF-8 internal representation
**
** The Refu String is a Unicode String that has two versions. One is this and for the other check @ref RF_StringX to see what operations can be performed on extended Strings.
** Functions to convert to and from all UTF encoding exists but the internal representation is always at UTF-8. Once a
** a String has been created it is always assumed that the stream of bytes inside it is valid UTF-8 since every function
** performs a UTF-8 check unless otherwise specified.
**
** All the functions which have @isinherited{StringX} on their description can be used with extended strings safely, since no specific
** version of the function exists, or needs to exist to manipulate Extended Strings. To make the documentation even clearer the functions that should not
** be used with the extended string are marked with @notinherited{StringX}
**
