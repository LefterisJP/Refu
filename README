To learn more information about the library visit:
http://refu.realintelligence.net


This is the root directory of the Refu library.

To compile the library edit the appropriate configuration file:
1)**Windows**:refu_config_win32 
and run the rfb_win32.exe
 
2)**Linux**: refu_config_linux and run rfb_linux 
executable
In linux you may get a "permission denied error" while attempting
to execute the refu builder. If so then run
chmod 755 /rfb_linux to give it executable permissions.

As mentioned in the beginning visit  http://refu.realintelligence.net
