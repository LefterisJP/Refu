To compile the library edit the appropriate configuration file:

and run the rfb_win32.exe
 
2)**Linux**: refu_config_linux and run rfb_linux 
executable
In linux you may get a "permission denied error" while attempting
to execute the refu builder. If so then run
chmod 755 /rfb_linux to give it executable permissions.
