Refu C Library

Refu is a C library aiming to act as the runtime library of a programming language
I am workinG on my free time. It evolved from a C/C++ library

To compile the library make sure you have Python2 installed in your system and simply
run the ./scons.py executable in the main directory to build it. There are 2 build
targets available, a shared and a static target. They can be built by issuing either
./scons.py static or ./scons.py shared  or both. Cleaning a target is done with the
-c option. For more information about the usage of scons look at http://www.scons.org

There are some simple test under the Tests directory which can also be seen as
examples of usage of the library. You can execute them by issuing ./run_tests.py

More information and a documentation page about the library will eventually appear
under http://clib.refu.co
