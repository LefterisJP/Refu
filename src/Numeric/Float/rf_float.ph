** This file contains float related functions that allow
** us to transform a float into ascii. In the beginning I attempted
** my own implementation of converting a double to a string but finally went with David M. Gay.'s
** dtoa() algorithm.  You can get your own copy and/or more information
** here: http://www.netlib.org/fp/
**
** It's used by the String/format.h functions.
** It's a private header since there is no need to expose this functionality to the user.
** If more functions are added this may change

//! @details
//! Trailing zeroes are supressed from the returned string. If d is +-Infinity or NaN,
//! then *decpt is set to 9999.
//! @param mode Possible values are:
//! + @c 0: Will return the shortest string that yields d when read in and rounded to nearest.
//! + @c 1: Like 0, but with Steele & White stopping rule;e.g. with IEEE P754 arithmetic , mode 0 gives
//! 1e23 whereas mode 1 gives 9.999999999999999e22.
//! + @c 2: Will return a string with @c ndigits maximum number of significand digits (max(1,ndigits)).
//!			Trailing zeroes are suppressed.
//! + @c 3: Will return a string with @c ndigits @b after the decimal point.
//!         Trailing zeros are suppressed, and @c ndigits can be negative.
//! + @c 4,5: similar to 2 and 3, respectively, but (in
//!			round-nearest mode) with the tests of mode 0 to
//!			possibly return a shorter string that rounds to d.
//!			With IEEE arithmetic and compilation with
//!			-DHonor_FLT_ROUNDS, modes 4 and 5 behave the same
//!			as modes 2 and 3 when FLT_ROUNDS != 1.
//! + @c 6-9: Debugging modes similar to mode - 4:  don't try
//!			fast floating-point estimate (if applicable).
//!
//! Values of mode other than 0-9 are treated as mode 0.
//! Sufficient space is allocated to the return value
//! to hold the suppressed trailing zeros.
//! @param ndigits The number of digits after the decimal point
//! @param decpt The position of the radix character relative to the beginning of the string shall be stored
//! in the integer pointed to by decpt (negative means to the left of the returned digits).If value is zero,
//! it is unspecified whether the integer pointed to by decpt would be 0 or 1. The radix character shall not be included in the returned string.
//! @param sign If the sign of the result is negative, the integer pointed to by sign shall be non-zero; otherwise, it shall be 0.
//! @param rve If not null, *rve is set to point to the end of the return value
//! @return A null terminated string containing the digits of @c d. No memory is allocated, unless it is a pathological case.
