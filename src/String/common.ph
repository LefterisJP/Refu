//! @brief Internal version of rfString_Find, used for byte position.
//!
//! @isinherited{StringX}
//! Finds the existence of String sstr inside this string with the given options. You have the
//! option to either match case or perform a case-insensitive search. In addition you can search
//! for the exact string and not it just being a part of another string. This is an internal version
//! used by other functions to obtain the byte position instead of the character position.
//! @param thisstr This string we want to search in @inhtype{String,StringX}
//! @param sstr The substring string we want to search for @inhtype{String,StringX}
//! @param options Bitflag options denoting some options for the search. Give 0 for the defaults. Can have values:
//! + @c RF_CASE_IGNORE: If you want the found substring to ignore the case and returns success for any occurence of the string in any case.
//!     Default search option is to @b match the case. For now this works only for characters of the english language.
//! + @c RF_MATCH_WORD: If you want the found substring to be exact. For example an exact search for @e "HELLO" in the string
//!     @e "HELLOWORLD" would return a failure. Default search is to return any found substring.
//! @return Returns the byte position of the found substring or RF_FAILURE for not found
//! @endinternal
