//! If no other tag exists as a sibling then the function will

//!
//! Also if during failing to find a sibling the root tag closes then
//! the function will return @c RE_XML_EOF
//! @param[in] x The xml handler for which to move

//! calling @ref rfXMLTag_Deinit() on it later.

//! @brief Moves out of the current tag's position in the file
//!
//! Using this function you have a choice to move either at the beginning of the parent or at the beginning of the parent's next tag.
//! If the parent is the root and we attempt to use this function then basically it returns the file pointer to part of the file
//! in the beginning where the root tag opens
//!
//! If an error occurs then the function attempts to position the file pointer
//! to the same position it was before the function call. That is not guaranteed to work at all times.
//! @param[in] x The xml handler for which to move
//! @param[in] after A boolean value. If @c true then when going out of the current tag the file pointer is positioned after
//! its parent and if @c false, right at the beginning of its parent
//! @return Returns RF_SUCCESS on success and otherwise it can return one of:
//! + @c RF_FAILURE: If the current tag is the root
//! + @c RE_XML_EOF: If the root tag closed, so it's impossible to return another tag
//! + @c RE_XML_UNEXPECTED_EOF: If the end of file was unexpectedly encountered during parsing
